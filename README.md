## William Vann - Homework 6

### Principal Findings:

(1) My linear regression analysis for a random sample of approximately 500 world cities shows a strong correlation between **temperature** and **distance from the equator**. 

(2) The first scatter plot in the WeatherPy notebook nicely visualizes that temperatures go up as you get nearer to the equator (latitude = 0), and go down as you get further from the equator.

(3) Additional linear regression analyses on this dataset show no meaningful correlations between latitude and the following features: _humidity, cloudiness, wind speed_.

** Screenshot file, WeatherPy notebook, and VacationPy notebook are in the /starter_code folder **

** All plots png files, the cities csv file, and an api_call_data.txt logfile are in the /output_data folder **
